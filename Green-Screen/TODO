- Make the update faster (the process() method in ImagePanel).
  Right now, the program is updating the
  entire picture (background + foreground) everytime
  a new stuff happens.

  Need a smarter (efficient) way of updating by just
  updating the area that changed, not the
  entire picture.

  The code will probably look very nasty
  from the initial attempt

- Clean up ImagePanel
  Code is very ugly right now
